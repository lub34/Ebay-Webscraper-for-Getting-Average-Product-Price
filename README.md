# Ebay-Webscraper-for-Getting-Average-Product-Price

The code in this repo is used to determine the average price of an item on Ebay given a valid search URL and the number of hits for said search. It is written in Python and requires the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` modules to run. To install these Python modules, I either recommend installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) (a Python environment manager that comes with these modules) or using the following pip install lines below:

[pip installation for requests module](https://www.agiratech.com/install-requests-library-in-python)

[pip installation for BeautifulSoup module](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/beautiful_soup/beautiful_soup_installation.htm)

**WHEN INSTALLING THE MODULES, BE MINDFUL WHETHER YOU'D PREFER THE PYTHON 2.x OR PYTHON 3.x VERSION(S)!!!**

At the moment, this code only works for searches of items marked with the 'New' condition on Ebay. The hope is for an update to come out around Christmas 2021 to improve the robustness of this code. Until then, hopefully what is currently available is still of use to you.

Also, shout out to Red Eyed Coder Club on YouTube, as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4hEAhHHykI) video of his greatly helped out with this project!
